                    <h1>?</h1>
                    <p>New Zealanders use about 295 million takeaway cups per year. That's 63 cups per person a year.  MOST of which go in to landfills. NONE go in recycle. A FEW get composted. Disposable cups that are "compostable" require commercial composting to biodegrade. A life span of the takeaway cup is less than 10 minutes. This takeaway cup is ONLY a single use cup. There is No recycling system for coffee cups in New Zealand. 
                        <br><br>People have concerns for the amount of energy it takes to make a keep cup than to a paper single use coffee cup.
For every 17 times you use your keep cup, you will start to save water, trees and energy.Over one year the KeepCup, when compared to disposable cups, reduces landfill by at least 99%.Over one year the KeepCup, compared to disposable cups, reduces water use by up to 90%. Over a year, use of a KeepCup reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 92% compared to disposable cups.

                    <h1>WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
                    <p>Takeaway cups are not recyclable in household bins therefore they end up in the garbage. Garbage can create air pollution due to gasses and chemicals evaporating from the waste. This air pollution can occur in open-air dumps, where a lot of our waste and electronic trash goes, and through incinerators used at garbage disposal sites. The air pollution from incineration can be so bad, in fact, that it can even release toxic substances that can contribute to acid rain. Other garbage will release methane as it wastes away, and methane is one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming – and can also be ignited to cause an explosion.

<br><br>Remember, much of our stuff these days is made with chemicals. These chemicals don’t just disappear when they end up in the dump – they will continue to exist and cause environmental problems for a long time. Getting rid of your trash in an environmentally sustainable way is one of the best things we can do for the earth!
